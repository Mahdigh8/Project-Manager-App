Sure, here's an idea for an advanced Django web app with REST API: a project management tool similar to Trello or Asana. This project will have various features to manage tasks, projects, teams, and deadlines.

### Database Schema:

1. **User**:

   - id
   - username
   - email
   - password (hashed)
   - date_joined

2. **Team**:
   - id
   - name
   - members (Many-to-Many relationship with User)
3. **Project**:

   - id
   - name
   - description
   - team (Foreign Key to Team)
   - created_by (Foreign Key to User)
   - created_at
   - deadline

4. **Task**:
   - id
   - title
   - description
   - project (Foreign Key to Project)
   - assigned_to (Foreign Key to User)
   - created_by (Foreign Key to User)
   - created_at
   - due_date
   - status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)

### Features to be Implemented:

1. **User Management:**

   - User registration
   - User authentication (login/logout)
   - User profile management (update profile, change password)

2. **Team Management:**

   - Create a team
   - Invite members to join the team
   - Remove members from the team
   - Assign roles within the team (e.g., admin, member)

3. **Project Management:**

   - Create a project within a team
   - View all projects a user is involved in
   - Update project details
   - Set deadlines for projects

4. **Task Management:**

   - Create tasks within a project
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set due dates for tasks
   - Update task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
   - Comment on tasks
   - Attach files to tasks

5. **Dashboard:**

   - Overview of projects and tasks
   - Display upcoming deadlines
   - Notifications for task assignments, updates, and deadlines

6. **REST API:**

   - Implement CRUD operations for Users, Teams, Projects, and Tasks
   - Authentication and authorization using tokens
   - Pagination and filtering for lists (projects, tasks)
   - Custom endpoints for specific functionalities (e.g., get tasks assigned to a user, get projects of a team)

7. **Additional Features:**
   - Email notifications for task assignments, updates, and reminders
   - Search functionality for projects and tasks
   - Activity log to track changes made within the app

Building this project will provide you with a good understanding of Django, REST API development, user authentication, permissions, and database modeling. Additionally, you'll gain experience in frontend development if you decide to create a user interface for the web app.
